# Code-under review (will be updated soon)
# Predictive Maintenance for Smart Factories with Azure and LLM-powered Graphs

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Predictive Maintenance system for IoT-enabled smart factories using Azure cloud services and LLM-powered knowledge graphs. The system simulates real-time sensor data, applies machine learning for failure prediction, and integrates with Azure for cloud-based insights, aiming to reduce equipment downtime and improve operational efficiency.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:

- **NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset**: Simulated sensor data including temperature, vibration, and operational status for predictive maintenance.

## Project Workflow

### Data Handling & Preprocessing

- Simulate and ingest IoT sensor data.
- Store and preprocess data in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake.
- Clean and structure data for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Perform initial analysis to understand data patterns and anomalies.
- Visualize key metrics and trends using Azure Stream Analytics.

### Model Development

- Develop predictive models using Azure Machine Learning.
- Implement anomaly detection and failure prediction algorithms.
- Integrate LLM-powered knowledge graphs for contextual insights using Azure OpenAI.

### Deployment & Integration

- Deploy models and integrate with Azure cloud services.
- Create visualizations using Power BI or Azure Dashboards.
- Simulate real-time alerts and predictive insights.

### Evaluation & Feedback

- Assess model accuracy and prediction performance.
- Gather feedback for iterative improvements and refinements.
